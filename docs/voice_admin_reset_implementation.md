# Voice Admin Reset Implementation Summary

## Commands Implemented

### `/voice admin reset user <member>`
- **Purpose**: Purge all voice-related data for a target user in the current guild and delete their active user-owned VC if it exists
- **Permissions**: Requires admin role check (reuses existing `is_admin()` decorator)
- **Behavior**:
  1. Resolves guild_id and user_id 
  2. Attempts to delete user's managed VC via `VoiceService.delete_user_owned_channel()`
  3. Purges all user voice data via `VoiceService.purge_voice_data_with_cache_clear()` with proper cache cleanup
  4. Logs action and replies with detailed summary of deleted rows and channels

### `/voice admin reset all`
- **Purpose**: Purge all users' voice-related data for the current guild and delete all user-owned managed VCs
- **Permissions**: Requires admin role check (reuses existing `is_admin()` decorator)
- **Behavior**:
  1. Resolves guild_id
  2. Enumerates and deletes all managed voice channels in the guild
  3. Purges all guild voice data via `VoiceService.purge_voice_data_with_cache_clear()` with cache cleanup
  4. Logs action and replies with summary of deleted rows and channels

## Database Utility

### `Database.purge_voice_data(guild_id: int, user_id: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, int]` ✅
- **Classmethod**: Properly implemented as requested
- **Transaction**: Uses single transaction for all deletions
- **Scope**: If `user_id` provided: Deletes all `(guild_id, user_id)` scoped rows; If `user_id` is None: Deletes all `guild_id` scoped rows
- **Tables covered**: All 7 voice-related tables:
  - `user_voice_channels` (uses `owner_id` column)
  - `voice_cooldowns`
  - `channel_settings`
  - `channel_permissions`
  - `channel_ptt_settings`
  - `channel_priority_speaker_settings`
  - `channel_soundboard_settings`
- **Return**: Dict of `{table_name: rows_deleted}`
- **Error Handling**: Proper rollback on failure with logging

## Service Helpers

### `VoiceService.delete_user_owned_channel(guild_id: int, user_id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]` ✅
- **Purpose**: Find active managed VC by DB lookup for `(guild_id, user_id)`
- **Channel Deletion**: Safely deletes Discord channel (ignores 404/403 errors)
- **Cache Management**: Removes from in-memory `managed_voice_channels` cache
- **Return**: Summary dict with `success`, `channel_deleted`, `channel_id`, and `error` fields
- **Logging**: Comprehensive info and warning level logs

### `VoiceService.purge_voice_data_with_cache_clear(guild_id: int, user_id: Optional[int] = None) -> Dict[str, int]` ✅ **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Combines database purging with proper cache management
- **Database**: Calls `Database.purge_voice_data()` for transactional deletion
- **Cache Cleanup**: Automatically removes affected channels from `managed_voice_channels` cache
- **Intelligent Cache**: For user scope, finds specific user's channel; for guild scope, gets all guild channels
- **Return**: Same format as Database method - dict of `{table_name: rows_deleted}`
- **Logging**: Detailed info logs with both database and cache statistics

## Safety Features
- **Idempotency**: Commands can be run multiple times safely
- **Error Handling**: Discord API errors (404/403) are caught and logged
- **Transactional**: All database operations use single transactions with rollback
- **Permissions**: Admin role validation on all commands
- **Cache Consistency**: Automatic cache cleanup prevents stale data
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Info-level logs for all actions with detailed statistics

## Command Structure
The commands are implemented as a subgroup under the existing voice command structure:
- `/voice admin reset user <member>`  
- `/voice admin reset all`

## Integration
- Commands now use `VoiceService.purge_voice_data_with_cache_clear()` instead of calling Database directly
- Ensures proper cache management alongside database operations
- Provides detailed feedback with per-table deletion counts
- Comprehensive embed responses with color-coded success/warning indicators

## Testing Results
- ✅ Bot starts successfully with new commands
- ✅ All syntax checks pass
- ✅ Commands registered and synced globally
- ✅ Database and service methods created with correct signatures
- ✅ New `purge_voice_data_with_cache_clear` method properly integrates database and cache operations
- ✅ Commands use proper service abstraction instead of direct database access

## Files Modified
1. `services/db/database.py` - Already had `purge_voice_data()` classmethod ✅
2. `services/voice_service.py` - Already had `delete_user_owned_channel()` + **NEW** `purge_voice_data_with_cache_clear()` method ✅
3. `cogs/voice/commands.py` - Updated admin reset commands to use proper service abstraction ✅

## Key Improvements Made
- **Service Abstraction**: Commands now use VoiceService methods instead of direct Database calls
- **Cache Consistency**: New `purge_voice_data_with_cache_clear()` ensures cache and database stay in sync
- **Better Architecture**: Follows proper layering - Commands → Service → Database
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Detailed embed responses with per-table statistics

All requirements have been implemented and enhanced with proper software architecture patterns.
