# Log Error Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ❌ Missing `announcement_events` Table

**Error:** 
```
BulkAnnouncer threshold watch error: no such table: announcement_events
```

**Root Cause:** The `announcement_events` table was being used by the announcement system but was not included in the database schema initialization.

**Fix:** 
- Added the `announcement_events` table to `helpers/schema.py`
- Created migration file `migrations/008_add_announcement_events.sql`
- Ran schema initialization to create the missing table

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE announcement_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    old_status TEXT,
    new_status TEXT,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    announced_at INTEGER DEFAULT NULL
);
```

### 2. ❌ Discord Interaction Timeout

**Error:** 
```
discord.errors.NotFound: 404 Not Found (error code: 10062): Unknown interaction
```

**Root Cause:** Discord interactions expire after 15 minutes. If a user clicks a button on an old verification message, the interaction is no longer valid.

**Fix:** 
- Enhanced error handling in `helpers/views.py` for the `verify_button_callback`
- Added specific handling for error code 10062 (Unknown interaction)
- Added user-friendly error message when interactions expire

**Code Changes:**
```python
try:
    await interaction.response.send_modal(modal)
except discord.HTTPException as e:
    if e.code == 10062:  # Unknown interaction (expired)
        logger.warning(f"Interaction expired for user {member.display_name}")
        try:
            await interaction.followup.send(
                "⚠️ This verification button has expired. Please request a new verification message.",
                ephemeral=True
            )
        except Exception:
            logger.debug("Could not send expiration notice to user")
    else:
        raise
```

### 3. ❌ Double Interaction Response

**Error:** 
```
discord.errors.InteractionResponded: This interaction has already been responded to before
```

**Root Cause:** Race condition where multiple tasks try to respond to the same interaction.

**Fix:** 
- The existing `helpers/discord_api.py` already had good race condition handling
- The `send_message` function properly catches code 40060 and falls back to followup
- No additional changes needed - this error is handled gracefully

## Files Modified

1. **`helpers/schema.py`**
   - Added `announcement_events` table definition
   - Added indexes for better query performance

2. **`helpers/views.py`**
   - Enhanced error handling for expired interactions
   - Added user-friendly error messages

3. **`migrations/008_add_announcement_events.sql`**
   - New migration file for the announcement_events table

## Verification

✅ **Database Fix Verified:**
- announcement_events table created successfully
- Test announcement event enqueued without errors

✅ **Code Quality:**
- No lint errors in modified files
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Proper error logging added

✅ **Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of expired interactions
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback mechanisms in place

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. **No more "no such table: announcement_events" warnings**
2. **Better user experience for expired verification buttons**
3. **Graceful handling of interaction race conditions**
4. **Proper announcement event tracking**

The bot should now handle these edge cases gracefully without crashing or producing confusing error messages.
