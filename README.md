Welcome to the Discord Verification Bot repository. This bot helps manage user verification within our Discord server by ensuring that only verified members can access certain channels and features. Here's a comprehensive guide to understanding, setting up, and contributing to the project.

## üöÄ Features

- **Token-Based Verification:** Users receive a unique token to verify their membership.
- **Role Assignment:** Automatically assigns roles based on verification status.
- **Cooldown System:** Limits verification attempts to prevent spam (once a day).
