# TEST Squadron Discord Verification Bot

Hey TEST Devs!

Welcome to the Discord Verification Bot repository. This bot helps manage user verification within our Discord server by ensuring that only verified members can access certain channels and features. Here's a quick rundown of what this bot does and how to use it.

## 🚀 Features

- **Token-Based Verification:** Users receive a unique token to verify their membership.
- **Role Assignment:** Automatically assigns roles based on verification status.
- **Cooldown System:** Limits verification attempts to prevent spam (once a day).
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Clears old messages in the verification channel on startup to keep things tidy.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles permission issues and role hierarchy constraints.
