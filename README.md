# TEST Squadron Discord Bot

Welcome to the **TEST Squadron Discord Bot** repository. This bot helps manage user verification within our Discord server and provides advanced voice channel management features. The codebase has been optimized for both human maintainability and AI agent comprehension.

## 🚀 Features

- **Token-Based Verification:** Users receive a unique token to verify their membership.
- **Role Assignment:** Automatically assigns roles based on verification status.
- **Cooldown System:** Limits verification attempts to prevent spam and abuse.
- **Voice Channel Management:** Users can create, manage, and customize their own voice channels.
- **Persistent Settings:** User channel settings are stored in a database for a consistent experience.
- **Interactive Modals and Views:** Provides an interactive user experience with Discord's UI components.
- **Persistent Verification Message:** The bot keeps a single verification message in the verification channel — it stores the message ID in `verification_message_id.json` and will reuse that message instead of creating duplicates. It does not currently delete old messages on startup.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Gracefully handles permission issues and logs errors for debugging.
- **🤖 AI-Agent Optimizations:** Structured prompts, schemas, defensive retry patterns, and comprehensive type safety for AI development assistance.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Discord Bot Permissions

The bot requires specific Discord permissions to function properly. **Do not grant Administrator permissions** - instead, grant only these specific permissions for security:

#### Required Permissions:
- **View Channels** - Read messages and see channels
- **Send Messages** - Send responses and notifications  
- **Embed Links** - Send rich embed messages
- **Read Message History** - Access previous messages for context
- **Use Slash Commands** - Register and respond to slash commands
- **Manage Roles** - Assign verification and member roles
- **Manage Channels** - Create/delete voice channels and manage categories
- **Connect** - Connect to voice channels
- **Move Members** - Move users between voice channels
- **Change Nickname** - Update user nicknames during verification
- **Manage Nicknames** - Update other users' nicknames

#### Permission Setup:
1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to Roles → [Bot Role]
3. Enable only the permissions listed above
4. Ensure the bot's role is positioned high enough to manage the roles it needs to assign
5. For voice categories: Right-click the voice category → Edit Category → Permissions → Add bot role with "Manage Channels" permission

#### Role Configuration:
Configure admin roles in `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
roles:
  bot_admins: [123456789012345678]  # Role IDs that can use admin commands
  lead_moderators: [987654321098765432]  # Additional elevated roles
```

### Admin Commands

The bot includes several administrative commands for configuration and management. All admin commands require users to have either the **Bot Admin** or **Lead Moderator** role configured in `config/config.yaml`.

> **💡 Live Command Discovery**: For the most up-to-date list of available commands, use `/help` in Discord or `/status` for detailed bot information. Commands listed below represent the core functionality but may not reflect the latest additions or changes.

#### General Admin Commands

| Command | Description | Required Role | Usage |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| `/status` | Show detailed bot health and status information | Bot Admin / Lead Moderator | `/status detailed:true` |
| `/guild-config` | Show current guild configuration (roles, channels, voice settings) | Bot Admin / Lead Moderator | `/guild-config` |
| `/set-config` | Set a guild configuration value | Bot Admin | `/set-config key:"voice.cooldown_seconds" value:"30"` |
| `/reset-all` | Reset verification timers for all members | Bot Admin | `/reset-all` |
| `/reset-user` | Reset verification timer for a specific user | Bot Admin / Lead Moderator | `/reset-user member:@username` |

| `/verify check` | Check verification status for multiple users (read-only) | Bot Admin / Lead Moderator | `/verify check targets:users members_text:"@user1 @user2"` |

#### Voice Admin Commands (`/voice` group)

| Command | Description | Required Role | Usage |
|---------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| `/voice setup` | Set up voice channel system (create JTC channels and category) | Bot Admin | `/voice setup category:#Voice-Channels num_channels:2` |
| `/voice admin reset` | Reset voice data with modern safety features | Bot Admin | `/voice admin reset scope:user member:@username` or `/voice admin reset scope:all confirm:YES` |
| `/voice admin_list` | View saved voice channel settings for a user | Bot Admin | `/voice admin_list user:@username` |

#### User Voice Commands (`/voice` group)

| Command | Description | Available To | Usage |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| `/voice list` | List all custom permissions and settings in your voice channel | Voice channel owners | `/voice list` |
| `/voice claim` | Claim ownership of a voice channel if the original owner left | All users | `/voice claim` |
| `/voice transfer` | Transfer ownership of your voice channel to another user | Voice channel owners | `/voice transfer user:@username` |
| `/voice help` | Show help information for voice commands | All users | `/voice help` |
| `/voice owner` | List all voice channels managed by the bot and their owners | Any member | `/voice owner` |

> **Note**: Voice channel settings are automatically presented via an interactive interface when you create a channel. Use `/voice list` to view your current settings.

#### Configuration Examples

**Setting Voice Cooldown:**
```
/set-config key:"voice.cooldown_seconds" value:"30"
```

**Setting Custom Voice Settings:**
```
/set-config key:"voice.max_channels_per_user" value:"3"
/set-config key:"voice.channel_name_template" value:"{user}'s Channel"
```

**Viewing Current Configuration:**
```
/guild-config
```

**Setting Up Voice System:**
```
/voice setup category:#Voice-Channels num_channels:3
```

#### Verification Status Check Examples

The `/verify check` command provides read-only verification status checking with multiple targeting modes:

**Check specific users:**
```
/verify check targets:"specific users" members_text:"@user1 @user2 123456789012345678"
```

**Check all members in a voice channel:**
```
/verify check targets:"voice channel" channel:#General-Voice show_details:true
```

**Check all members in any active voice channel:**
```
/verify check targets:"all active voice" show_details:true export_csv:true
```

**Options:**
- `show_details:true` - Include detailed status, RSI handles, voice channels, and last update times
- `export_csv:true` - Send a detailed CSV file via DM with full results

The command respects the `auto_recheck.batch.max_users_per_run` configuration limit (default: 50 users per check).

### Permission System

The bot uses a **role-based permission system** rather than Discord's built-in Administrator permission for security:

#### Role Hierarchy:
1. **Bot Admin** - Full administrative access to all bot functions
2. **Lead Moderator** - Administrative access to most functions (excluding some sensitive operations)
3. **Regular Users** - Access to user-facing commands only

#### Permission Checks:
- Commands check for specific role IDs configured in `config/config.yaml`
- Multiple roles can be assigned the same permissions
- Role checks are performed on every command execution
- No Discord Administrator permission is required or recommended

#### Security Benefits:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only get necessary permissions
- **Granular Control**: Different roles can have different permission levels
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions are logged with user information
- **No Overreach**: Bot cannot perform server-wide admin actions

For detailed setup instructions, refer to `SETUP.txt` in the repository or the documentation source files under `docs/` (for example, `docs/verification_workflow.md`).

## 📄 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available and includes:

- **Modules Documentation**: Detailed explanations of each module and its components.
- **Usage Instructions**: Step-by-step guides on how to use the bot.

### Quick Start

1. **Set up Discord OAuth2** credentials in `.env` (see [Web Dashboard README](web/README.md))
2. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd web/backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8081
   ```
3. **Start the frontend** (in a new terminal):
   ```bash
   cd web/frontend
   npm install
