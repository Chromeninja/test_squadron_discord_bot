# TEST Squadron Discord Bot

Welcome to the **TEST Squadron Discord Bot** repository. This bot helps manage user verification within our Discord server and provides advanced voice channel management features. Here's a comprehensive guide to understanding, setting up, and contributing to the project.

## üöÄ Features

- **Token-Based Verification:** Users receive a unique token to verify their membership.
- **Role Assignment:** Automatically assigns roles based on verification status.
- **Cooldown System:** Limits verification attempts to prevent spam and abuse.
- **Voice Channel Management:** Users can create, manage, and customize their own voice channels.
- **Persistent Settings:** User channel settings are stored in a database for a consistent experience.
- **Interactive Modals and Views:** Provides an interactive user experience with Discord's UI components.
- **Persistent Verification Message:** The bot keeps a single verification message in the verification channel ‚Äî it stores the message ID in `verification_message_id.json` and will reuse that message instead of creating duplicates. It does not currently delete old messages on startup.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Gracefully handles permission issues and logs errors for debugging.
