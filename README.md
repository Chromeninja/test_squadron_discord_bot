# TEST Squadron Discord Bot

Welcome to the **TEST Squadron Discord Bot** repository. This bot helps manage user verification within our Discord server and provides advanced voice channel management features. The codebase has been optimized for both human maintainability and AI agent comprehension.

## 🚀 Features

- **Token-Based Verification:** Users receive a unique token to verify their membership.
- **Role Assignment:** Automatically assigns roles based on verification status.
- **Cooldown System:** Limits verification attempts to prevent spam and abuse.
- **Voice Channel Management:** Users can create, manage, and customize their own voice channels.
- **Persistent Settings:** User channel settings are stored in a database for a consistent experience.
- **Interactive Modals and Views:** Provides an interactive user experience with Discord's UI components.
- **Persistent Verification Message:** The bot keeps a single verification message in the verification channel — it stores the message ID in `verification_message_id.json` and will reuse that message instead of creating duplicates. It does not currently delete old messages on startup.
- **Error Handling and Logging:** Gracefully handles permission issues and logs errors for debugging.
- **🤖 AI-Agent Optimizations:** Structured prompts, schemas, defensive retry patterns, and comprehensive type safety for AI development assistance.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Discord Bot Permissions

The bot requires specific Discord permissions to function properly. **Do not grant Administrator permissions** - instead, grant only these specific permissions for security:

#### Required Permissions:
- **View Channels** - Read messages and see channels
- **Send Messages** - Send responses and notifications  
- **Embed Links** - Send rich embed messages
- **Read Message History** - Access previous messages for context
- **Use Slash Commands** - Register and respond to slash commands
- **Manage Roles** - Assign verification and member roles
- **Manage Channels** - Create/delete voice channels and manage categories
- **Connect** - Connect to voice channels
- **Move Members** - Move users between voice channels
- **Change Nickname** - Update user nicknames during verification
- **Manage Nicknames** - Update other users' nicknames

#### Permission Setup:
1. Go to your Discord server settings
2. Navigate to Roles → [Bot Role]
3. Enable only the permissions listed above
4. Ensure the bot's role is positioned high enough to manage the roles it needs to assign
5. For voice categories: Right-click the voice category → Edit Category → Permissions → Add bot role with "Manage Channels" permission

#### Role Configuration:
Configure role access levels in `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
roles:
  bot_owner: 123456789012345678  # Bot owner user ID (full system access)
  bot_admins: [123456789012345678, 987654321098765432]  # Bot Admin role IDs
  discord_managers: [111111111111111111]  # Discord Manager role IDs
  moderators: [222222222222222222]  # Moderator role IDs
  staff: [333333333333333333]  # Staff role IDs (read-only access)
```

**Web Dashboard Access:**
- **Bot Admin & Moderator**: Full access (user recheck, reset voice, manage settings)
- **Staff & Higher**: Read-only access (view dashboards, search users, statistics)
- All role levels require at least one guild where they have the configured role

### Admin Commands

The bot includes several administrative commands for configuration and management. All admin commands require users to have the appropriate role level configured in `config/config.yaml` (see [Permission System](#permission-system) for details).

> **💡 Live Command Discovery**: For the most up-to-date list of available commands, use `/help` in Discord or `/status` for detailed bot information. Commands listed below represent the core functionality but may not reflect the latest additions or changes.

#### General Admin Commands

> **Note**: Voice channel settings are automatically presented via an interactive interface when you create a channel. Use `/voice list` to view your current settings.

#### Configuration Examples

**Setting Voice Cooldown:**
```
/set-config key:"voice.cooldown_seconds" value:"30"
```

**Setting Custom Voice Settings:**
```
/set-config key:"voice.max_channels_per_user" value:"3"
/set-config key:"voice.channel_name_template" value:"{user}'s Channel"
```

**Viewing Current Configuration:**
```
/guild-config
```

**Setting Up Voice System:**
```
/voice setup category:#Voice-Channels num_channels:3
```

#### Verification Status Check Examples

The `/verify check` command provides read-only verification status checking with multiple targeting modes:

**Check specific users:**
```
/verify check targets:"specific users" members_text:"@user1 @user2 123456789012345678"
```

**Check all members in a voice channel:**
```
/verify check targets:"voice channel" channel:#General-Voice show_details:true
```

**Check all members in any active voice channel:**
```
/verify check targets:"all active voice" show_details:true export_csv:true
```

**Options:**
- `show_details:true` - Include detailed status, RSI handles, voice channels, and last update times
- `export_csv:true` - Send a detailed CSV file via DM with full results

The command respects the `auto_recheck.batch.max_users_per_run` configuration limit (default: 50 users per check).

### Permission System

Both the Discord bot and web dashboard use a **hierarchical role-based permission system** rather than Discord's built-in Administrator permission for security:

#### Role Hierarchy (Highest to Lowest Privilege):
1. **Bot Owner** - Full system access (user must be bot owner in config)
2. **Bot Admin** - Full administrative access to all functions
3. **Discord Manager** - Advanced administrative capabilities
4. **Moderator** - Moderation and user management capabilities
5. **Staff** - Read-only access to dashboards and status information
6. **Regular Users** - Access to user-facing commands and voice channel management only

#### Permission Examples:
- **Bot Admin**: Can recheck users, reset voice settings, manage guild configuration
- **Moderator**: Can recheck users, view logs, manage user-specific settings
- **Staff**: Can view dashboards, search users, monitor statistics (read-only)
- **Regular Users**: Can manage their own voice channels, request verification

#### Permission Checks:
- Commands and API endpoints check for specific role IDs configured in `config/config.yaml`
- Web dashboard enforces role validation on every request with TTL-based caching (30 second default)
- Live Discord role validation: Access is immediately revoked if user's Discord roles change
- Multiple roles can be assigned the same permission level
- No Discord Administrator permission is required or recommended

#### Security Benefits:
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only get necessary permissions
- **Granular Control**: Different roles can have different permission levels
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions are logged with user information
- **No Overreach**: Bot cannot perform server-wide admin actions
